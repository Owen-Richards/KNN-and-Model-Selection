# KNN-and-Model-Selection

The assignment requested to implement a simple classifer, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), from scratch.
It also required to implement a 4-fold Cross Validation strategy for selecting the best k for kNN classification.
The three types of input features that were created to analyse the cross validation accuracy were: BOW representation, 
TF-IDF representation and BERT Embeddings.

The assignment asked to report the cross validation accuracy for all values of k as well as the best k, for all three types of 
input features. In my report I discussed why some values work better than others. Also I reported the test accuracy for each type of input feature 
using the best k.
